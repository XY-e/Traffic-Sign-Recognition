# Traffic Sign Recognition

This project uses **deep learning (CNN)** to classify German traffic signs from the **GTSRB dataset**.  
We train a **custom CNN model** and compare its performance with a **transfer learning approach (MobileNetV2)**.

## Project Description
Traffic sign recognition is an important component of self-driving cars and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).  
The goal of this project is to classify traffic signs into one of **43 categories** using deep learning models.

### Features:
- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
- Data augmentation for robustness
- Training a **custom CNN** from scratch
- Training a **transfer learning model (MobileNetV2)**
- Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
